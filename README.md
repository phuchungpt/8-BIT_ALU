Project Description:
This project involves the design and verification of an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with the following key features:

Basic Operations: The ALU performs the four fundamental operations:

Bitwise AND

Bitwise OR

Addition

Subtraction

Flags: The ALU will also include three important flags to capture the status of the operations:

▪ Carry Flag (C): set when there is a carry from the MSB of the result

▪ Negative Flag (N): set when a math operation results in a negative result

▪ Zero Flag (S): set with a math operation results in a zero result

Goals:

To design an efficient and functional 8-bit ALU capable of performing basic arithmetic and logical operations.

To ensure accurate flag updates that reflect the status of the operations (Carry, Negative, and Zero).

To verify the ALU using extensive simulation and testing with different inputs and edge cases.

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple but essential component in digital systems, providing a foundation for more advanced ALU designs.
